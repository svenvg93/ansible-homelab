# Ansible Homelab Automation

This repository automates the configuration and management of a personal homelab using [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/). Its primary goals:

* Install and configure Docker
* Deploy Node Exporter for Prometheus metrics
* Enroll machines in Tailscale VPN
* Install and configure Telegraf monitoring agent
* Perform routine system maintenance tasks
* Set timezone and basic system parameters

By the end of this guide, you’ll know how to:

1. Prepare your control node and target hosts
2. Structure inventory and variable files
3. Run individual playbooks or the full site
4. Customize roles and playbooks to your own needs
